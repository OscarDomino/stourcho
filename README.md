Websites demo "# stourcho"
This demo website is a copy of a site created for Stour Choral Society which was published in 2014 and maintained until August 2020. 
Before starting the work, I conducted a survey of all members, to find out what the society wanted from a website. I then designed a structure for the site, 
including menus and submenus. I looked at a lot of other websites for similar organisations for ideas, 
and used the "Inspect Element" tool to learn how some of the features had been produced.

I used WWW Schools to help me learn basic HTML and CSS, as well as using websites such as Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow and Youtube to help me solve problems. 
A PHP contact form was included and some Javascript for elements such as a 'Back' button. 
Paintshop Pro was used to create the header image, which was based around a photograph of the River Stour, merging it with the society logo and a recent photo of the choir.

I am proud of what I achieved with the website and I had a lot of positive feedback from the members. 
I put a lot of thought into making the site accessible and simple to use, for some of the older members of the choir. 
One member was blind so needed to be able to use a text reader, so I made sure I included alt text where necessary and tested the site using a reader myself.

More recently I realised that the website needed updating to bring it in line with current trends, and to make it responsive. 
The header also needed updating after a change in Music Director, which meant the photo would have been out of date. 
Additionally, the contact form had started to attract a lot of spam and I realised the anti-spam measures included were no longer working. 
I started some work on the index page, adding a drop-down menu and making it responsive to changes in screen size. 
These changes were never implemented because the decision was made to develop a completely new site on WordPress, 
which would eventually be handed over to a new editor to maintain.

I developed the new WordPress site using a theme called 'Faith', and installed plugins for features like the social icons menu and contact form. 
This site has now been handed over but no changes have yet been made. 
I am still an administrator for the site and have access to cPanel, in case the new editor needs assistance.
